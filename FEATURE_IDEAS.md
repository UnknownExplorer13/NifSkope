# Feature Ideas

A list of features I'd like to implement at some point. These features will probably only be implemented for Skyrim and/or Fallout 4 nif files as that's what I work with the most.

* Edit gavrant's index item array value code for textures to show what each slot is used for (slot 0 = Diffuse, slot 1 = Normal, etc.)

* A spell to automate the setup of specific shader types (Default, Environment Mapping, Glow, etc.)

* A graph/node-based visual editor widget similar to [Skyrim VFX Editor](https://github.com/jgernandt/skyrim-vfx-editor) (very unlikely given my severe lack of coding knowledge)
